This python project is a simple turtle race game. It uses the Turtle module to create a race track with six turtles of different colors. Players can bet on which turtle they think will win the race. Once the user selects their bet, the race begins. Each turtle moves forward a random distance in each iteration of the loop. The first turtle to reach the right edge of the screen wins the race. If the winning turtle matches the user's bet, they win; otherwise, they lose. After the race ends, the program displays the outcome and waits for the user to click the screen to close the window.
